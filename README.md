About The Project
The Sharon E-commerce Platform (Angular Frontend) is the client-side application for an e-commerce solution. Built with Angular, it provides a dynamic and responsive user interface for customers to browse products, manage their shopping cart, and proceed through the checkout process. This repository specifically focuses on the frontend user experience and is designed to interact with a separate backend API (not included in this repository).

The aim of this project is to deliver a modern, performant, and user-friendly online shopping experience, showcasing best practices in Angular development.

Features
Product Catalog: Browse a wide range of products with detailed listings.

Product Details: View comprehensive information for each product, including descriptions, images, and pricing.

Shopping Cart: Add, update, and remove items from the cart seamlessly.

User Authentication: Secure user registration and login functionalities.

Responsive Design: Optimized for a consistent experience across various devices (desktops, tablets, mobile phones).

Search & Filtering: Easily find products using search queries and various filter options.

Checkout Flow: A streamlined process for completing purchases (requires backend integration).

Technologies Used
This project is built using the following key technologies:

Angular (v17+) - The core framework for building the single-page application.

TypeScript - A superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript, providing type safety and enhanced tooling.

HTML5 - For structuring the web content.

CSS / SCSS - For styling and responsive design. (Consider adding specific UI frameworks like Bootstrap, Angular Material, or Tailwind CSS if used).

RxJS - For reactive programming and handling asynchronous operations.

Angular CLI - For scaffolding, building, and serving Angular applications.
